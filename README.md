# Kood/Jõhvi Selection Sprint

These are all the functions I had to write for the selection sprint of the programming school kood/Jõhvi. Some of the functions use package main, but most use package sprint. As we were told it was a control measure so that malfunctioning code does not go too out of hand. Most of the functions are self written functions that already exist in popular Golang libraries. All of the code is in Golang because it is a simple language to understand and learn.
