### Kood/Jõhvi Selection Sprint

Kood/Jõhvi selection sprint is a three-week-long testing period during which participants complete tasks either individually or in a group. There are also three exams. This repository contains my solutions to the individual and group tasks that I had to complete. Every function starts with package sprint because it uses a package provided by the school itself.
